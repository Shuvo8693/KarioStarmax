# KarioStarmax

KarioStarmax is a smartwatch app currently under development, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This demo app communicates with supported smartwatches over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to receive and display data and to test watch features. Currently the app works with only specific watch models. The project will be gradually migrated to Flutter in future releases.
